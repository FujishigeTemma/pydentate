# pyDentate

This python project is based on a dentate gyrus network model developed in the [Soltesz Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/ivansolteszlab.html).
This project is maintained by Daniel Müller at the [Laboratory for Experimental Epileptology](http://www.meb.uni-bonn.de/agBeck/cms/front_content.php?idcat=333) Contact: danielmuellermsc@gmail.com
We are in very early development. No testing has been done. Some low-level design choices are still to be made and may change along the way. This project is in no way ready for distribution.
