# No module named neuron
Add the location of the neuron module to PYTHONPATH in the .bashrc
.bashrc is located in the home directory but it is hidden by default.
Type ls -la to find it
The neuron module was located by default in /usr/local/nrn/lib/python/
Add
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/nrn/lib/python/
to the .bashrc file

# Mechanisms don't compile
On linux this is most likely due to missing C++ dependencies.
I installed synaptic sudo apt-get install synaptic which is a pretty
convenient package manager. The error messages should give an ok idea
on what packages are missing. You can confirm that compilation works
on windows. Also make sure to delete all residual files from compilations
on windows in the directory.

# Parallel networks with neuron
The default installation of neuron does not come with parallel capabilities.
For parallel capabilities neuron needs to be compiled from source. Kristian
had a lot of problems getting neuron to compile with functioning parallel
processing and python as an alternative interpreter. Details follow.

# Testing parallel capabilities of compiled neuron
Tests are located in /neuron/nrn/src/parallel
To execute the tests you need to have root access for currently unknown reasons
