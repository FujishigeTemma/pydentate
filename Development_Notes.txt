# Standard Setup

To run the model you need to install neuron (nrn) and python. Python needs to know where to look for
the nrn binaries and the python module called neuron that comes with your neuron installation. This
is done through the environmental variable PYTHONPATH.

Execute the file test_neuron.py to see if your python environment finds neuron. The output tells
you the number of attributes that the h object has. On our Win7 system h has 407 attributes when
it is imported without gui and 608 when imported with gui. However, when the mechanisms necessary
to run the model are loaded h has 881 attributes.

# Parallel computing

Here is a good tutorial for parallel computing for neuron in python:
http://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/neuronpython/ballandstick5.html

The standard installation of neuron does not support parallel computing. To test if your neuron
supports parallel computing, execute test_parallel.py
